                   <center> <h1>New Orleans</h1><br></center>
                    New Orleans. NOLA. The Big Easy. A city by many names, all conjuring the jovial “Laissez les bons temps rouler!” (“Let the
            good times roll!”) attitude toward life the city is famous for. New Orleans is filled with scrumptious French-inspired
            Creole and Cajun food, live jazz, street performers, and an appreciation for all the temptations of life. Life
            is lived well here in the Big Easy. I first visited in 2006 on a road trip across the country. It was post–Hurricane
            Katrina and the city was in bad shape — buildings still laid vacant, trash strewn on the streets — and the city
            felt like a ghost town. Nonetheless, I was still impressed by the positive attitude the local residents maintained.
            Returning this year for Mardi Gras, I noticed that the city had changed. Not only had it cleaned itself up but
            many new areas of the city seemed to be bursting with life as well. After two lengthy visits, countless hours
            walking around and taking tours, listening to all the jazz this swing-dance lover could find, and eating as much
            crawfish as possible, I’ve compiled a non-definitive guide to exploring New Orleans: Day 1 Use this first day
            to walk around New Orleans, taking in its three main neighborhoods along the Mississippi River: The Garden District
            House in the Garden District of NOLA My favorite area of New Orleans, the Garden District is home to large and
            ornate historic mansions as well as some of the city’s best and trendiest restaurants and bars. Quiet and more
            relaxed than the French Quarter, it was developed in 1832 for the newly-rich Americans who settled in the city.
            The French Creoles wanted the Americans out of the French Quarter and, through some clever marketing about how
            the nouveau riche could build huge homes, convinced them to move here. Spend a few hours wandering the streets,
            seeing the old mansions, and visiting famous cemeteries like Lafayette Cemetery #1 in the central part of the
            district. The Riverfront/Warehouse District Right between the Garden District and the French Quarter, this area
            has seen an incredible revitalization over the last few years as old, empty warehouses have been turned into
            shops, art galleries, and trendy restaurants. Meander through the cobblestone streets, check out some art, and
            walk along the Mississippi before turning in to the French Quarter. The French Quarter St. Louis Cathedral and
            a cannon in the famous French Quarter End the day at the famous French Quarter, where you can see the old-style
            18th century French homes with wrought-iron balconies. The area was settled by the French (hence the name) in
            1718. The district is now a haven for drinkers on Bourbon Street, antique shoppers on Royal Street, and foodies
            seeking some of the best Cajun food in the city. Here you’ll find Jackson Square, St. Louis Cathedral, beautiful
            homes, and bars blaring top-notch jazz. The visitor center offers a detailed self-guided tour map. I suggest
            taking the Free Tours by Foot walking tours. They offer a ton of walking tours throughout the city. You’ll learn
            about the history of each neighborhood so you have an idea of what you’re looking at when you wander on your
            own. Try to get Denver for the Garden District tour — he’s one of the most knowledgeable tour guides I’ve ever
            come across. Day 2 Take a Voodoo Tour Outside of Rev Zombie's VooDoo Shop in NOLA New Orleans voodoo is a set
            of underground religious practices that came out of the African religious traditions of the slaves brought to
            the city. Voodoo and the occult are synonymous with New Orleans. From stories of ghosts and vampires to Marie
            Laveau (the city’s historic and most famous voodoo practitioner), New Orleans has a certain creep factor. The
            tours take you through the French Quarter and its cemeteries and teach you about the voodoo past of the city.
            The Voodoo Bone Lady Haunted Tours is one of the best. 1850 House During the period before the Civil War, slavery
            made white plantation owners very wealthy, and they built elaborate homes to show off their good fortune. They
            were the townhouses of the past. 1850 House is an example of what many of these townhouses looked like before
            the American Civil War. Located next to Jackson Square, this house is run by the city and decorated like an antebellum
            home. Audubon Park or New Orleans City Park Pond in New Orleans City Park at sunset New Orleans is more than
            just cityscapes. The city also has two stunning parks, and I’d highly recommend spending an afternoon wandering
            around one of them. They offer ponds, oak trees, and quiet areas that can recharge your mind and spirit (and
            relax your feet after so much walking!). Take a Ghost Tour I love ghost tours. Exploring the eerie side of cities
            is fascinating. What legends and myths does a city revolve around? What’s the dark side of a city’s past? Ghost
            tours delve into this stuff (whether you believe in ghosts or not!). New Orleans has many, many ghost stories
            that date back to the city’s founding, and it’s classified as one of the most haunted cities in the country.
            End the day with more creepiness on a ghost tour of the city. The ghost tour offered by Haunted History Tours
            is one of the best. Day 2 Take a Voodoo Tour Outside of Rev Zombie's VooDoo Shop in NOLA New Orleans voodoo is
